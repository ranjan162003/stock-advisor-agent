"""Store LLM API keys in the OS credential vault, never in plain files.

`keyring` maps to Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or the Secret
Service on Linux — all encrypted at rest and scoped to the current OS user.
Keys are only ever read back to call the provider they belong to, and are
never returned by the API.
